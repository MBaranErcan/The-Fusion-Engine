The Fusion Engine is a 3D graphics engine (more like a renderer, for now) built using OpenGL. It has a straightforward structure for creating 3D models, managing user input, and controlling various types of lighting.


# Features

•	Lighting: Supports directional, point, and spotlights with a global ambient light setting.

•	Model Loading: Loads and renders 3D models using the Assimp library.

•	Shader Management: Manages shaders for different rendering tasks.

•	Camera System.
